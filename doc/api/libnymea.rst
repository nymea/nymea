libnymea
========

``libnymea`` is the public C++ client library for interacting with nymead. It
provides high level abstractions for device discovery, state monitoring, and
rule execution.

Key modules
-----------

ClientConnection
   Manages the transport layer (WebSocket/TLS) and authentication.

DeviceManager
   Exposes all devices known to the nymea instance and notifies listeners about
   state changes.

RuleEngine
   Allows creating, updating, and deleting automation rules programmatically.

Using libnymea
--------------

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include <nymea/clientconnection.h>

   nymea::ClientConnection connection;
   connection.setHost("nymea.local");
   connection.open();

   QObject::connect(&connection, &nymea::ClientConnection::connected, []() {
       qInfo() << "Connected to nymea";
   });

Refer to the header files in ``libnymea`` for a comprehensive list of classes.
Autogenerated API reference pages can be produced using ``breathe`` or
``exhale`` once Doxygen output is available.
