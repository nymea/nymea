libnymea developer reference
=============================

``libnymea`` contains the Qt/C++ building blocks that plugins and
applications use to talk to ``nymead``.  The pages in this section replace
the historical QDoc files and provide an rst-based reference that Sphinx can
build directly.

The documentation is organised by responsibility.  Start with the overview
for library level conventions and follow the links for detailed class
reference material.
