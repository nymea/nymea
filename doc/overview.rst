Project overview
================

nymea is an open platform for integrating and automating IoT devices. The project
provides a server component, a plugin system to connect hardware and services,
and client-facing APIs that expose automation capabilities to third-party
applications. This documentation replaces the legacy QDoc based material with a
Sphinx driven site that is easier to maintain and extend.

The documentation is organised in four major sections:

* :doc:`getting-started/index` – installation, first steps, and quickstart guides.
* :doc:`developer/index` – information for contributors, plugin authors, and
  maintainers of nymea deployments.
* :doc:`api/index` – details about the JSON-RPC, CoAP, and libnymea APIs.
* :doc:`glossary` – important terminology used throughout the project.

Use the navigation on the left to explore each topic or the search box to find
specific information quickly.
