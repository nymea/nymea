  \class IntegrationPlugin
  \brief This is the base class interface for integration plugins.

  \ingroup things
  \inmodule libnymea

  Integration plugins extend nymea to allow integrating a device or online service, commonly referred to as thing in IoT.

  This is the base class to be subclassed when starting a new integration plugin.

*/

/*! \fn void IntegrationPlugin::configValueChanged(const ParamTypeId &paramTypeId, const QVariant &value);
    This signal is emitted when the \l{Param} with a certain \a paramTypeId of a \l{Thing} configuration changed the \a value.
*/

/*! \fn void IntegrationPlugin::autoThingsAppeared(const ThingDescriptors &thingDescriptors)
    A plugin emits this signal when new \l{Things} appears. For instance, a plugin connected to a bridge might detect
    that new devices have been connected to the bridge. Emitting this signal will cause those devices to be added as
    \l{Thing} to the nymea system and setupThing will be called for them.
*/

/*! \fn void IntegrationPlugin::autoThingDisappeared(const ThingId &id)
    A plugin should emit this signal when a thing with the given \a id is to be removed from the system. When emitting this signal,
    nymea will remove the \l{Thing} from the system and with it all the associated rules and child. Because of this, this signal
    should only be emitted when it's certain that the given device or online service  will never return to be available any more.
    This can only be used for things that have been added using \l{IntegrationPlugin::autoThingsAppeared}.
*/

/*! \fn void IntegrationPlugin::emitEvent(const Event &event)
    To produce a new event in the system, a plugin should create a new \l{Event} and emit this signal it with that \a event.
    Usually events are emitted in response to incoming data or other other events happening on the actua device or online service.
*/

/*! \fn void IntegrationPlugin::init()
    This will be called after constructing the IntegrationPlugin. Override this to do any initialisation work you need to do.
    While some initialization can also be done in the constructor, some resources like the hardwareManager might not be available
    at that point yet. When init() is called, it is guaranteed that the system is fully started up and ready for operation.
