    "description": "This interface can be used for heat pumps offering the smart grid label \"SG-Ready\". The modes can be set to the heatpump either through 2 digital outputs or directly using modbus registers. These modes should be used by an energy manager and are not intended to be set by a user since there are certain rules to consider when switching the SG mode.",
